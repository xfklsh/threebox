## 0.3.0

#### Enhancements

- Add an Object class: convenience methods to produce lines, spheres, tubes, and imported OBJ/MTL meshes, as well as a method to bring in THREE.Object3D's produced elsewhere with vanilla Three.js. Most of these are moveable, and have methods to move/rotate/rescale

- No need to call `tb.update()` after putting it in the custom layer's `render()` function.

#### Bug fixes

- Automatically adjust for viewport size (https://github.com/peterqliu/threebox/issues/43)

#### Deprecated (but still functional)
- `.setupDefaultLights()` has moved to an optional `defaultLights` parameter, in the third argument for Threebox().
- `tb.addAtCoordinate()` and `tb.moveToCoordinate()` have been deprecated. `tb.add(Object)` and `Object.setCoords()` replace them
